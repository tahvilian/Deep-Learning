In this project, the self-organizing map (SOM) method is applied to the credit card application dataset to detect the fraud between the banks' customers and then artificial nerual network (ANN) is applied  to predict the probability that each customer cheated or not. Thus the unsuprevised learning (SOM and supervised learning (ANN) methods should be combined. The dataset used here is obtained from "Deep Learning A-Z 2023: Neural Networks, AI & ChatGPT Prize" course. This project includes three parts:

*  Part 1: Implementing SOM to detect the fraud flag
*  Part 2: Going from Unsupervised to Supervised Deep Learning by using fraud flag as target
*  Part 3: Implementing ANN to estimate the probability of fraud for each customer
